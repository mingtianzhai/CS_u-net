The improved model replaces the backbone network of U-net with ResNet50, introduced semantic alignment module which expands the amplitude and mapping flexibility of the Gaussian function of its local channel. The improved residual network constructed using the idea of wide activation and CBAM attention mechanism replaces the FCN network of the global channel of the semantic alignment module in the improved model.
